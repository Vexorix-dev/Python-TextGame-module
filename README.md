# Python-TextGame-module
This is a module that is best for ASCII and/or text-based games. Got this idea from finding out about Rogue and thought about how hard it would be to recreate.
# TextGame Commands List
wasd_init(): Initializes the WASD movement. Use an if command with the variable 'wasd'. Example: if wasd=='w': print("Forward'). Curses is included, so you can use things like curses.KEY_UP to specify the arrow keys.
